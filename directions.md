This file is aimed at providing the foloowing milestones in the project.
1. Running non-alinged corpus with the current architecture.
2. Improving the architecture by adding more layers, changing variables such as kernel size, embedding size, number of filters.
3. Improving the current architecture of aligned corpus.
4. Learning to align data. TBD.
5. Implementing a growing kernel size as a function of timesteps aka linear kernel.
6. Training linear kernel architecture with non-aligned corpus.
7. Considering testing the architectures of MS dataset
8. Documenting the process into a solid paper.
9. Submitting a paper by fall 2017.
